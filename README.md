## Purpose

hoaxshell is a non-traditional windows reverse shell (powershell), currently undetected by Microsoft Defender and most other AV solutions, as it is solely based on http/https traffic. The tool is easy to use, it produces it's own powershell base64 encoded or raw payload, it supports session restoration and encryption (ssl).  
  
**Disclaimer**: The project is quite fresh and has not been widely tested.
